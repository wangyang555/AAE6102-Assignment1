function [level, variance] = momEstimator(syms, nWin)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The function estimates symbol level and variances using a method of moments
%
% Input:
%   syms        - Input, assumed Gaussian, BPSK symbols
%   nWin        - Moving average window length
%
% Output:
%   level       - Estimated symbol level
%   variance    - Estimated symbol variance
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Moving filter
filt = ones(nWin,1)/nWin;

% Squared input symbols
sqSyms = syms.^2;

% Moving average of squared input symbol
meanSqSyms = filter(filt,1,sqSyms);

% Moving variance
varSqSyms = filter(filt,1,(sqSyms-meanSqSyms).^2);

% Skip initial symbols
meanSqSyms   = meanSqSyms(nWin+1:end);
varSqSyms    = varSqSyms(nWin+1:end);

% Symbol variance and level
variance = meanSqSyms-sqrt(meanSqSyms.^2-varSqSyms/2);
level    = sqrt(meanSqSyms-variance);
