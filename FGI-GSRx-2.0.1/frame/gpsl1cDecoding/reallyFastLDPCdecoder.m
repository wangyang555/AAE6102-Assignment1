function v = reallyFastLDPCdecoder(H,r,I,var)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function decodes Low-density-parity-check code bit sequences
% The algorithm for this uses belief propagation and is based on Johannesson,
% R., & Zigaangirov, K. S. (2015). "Fundamentals of convolutional coding:
% Algorithm BPDMC" John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated. p. 535.
%
%
% Inputs:
%   H               - LDPC matrix
%   r               - Encoded bit sequence with possbile errors
%   I               - Number of maximum iterations in the algorithm
%   var             - Estimate for the symbol variance
%
% Outputs:
%   v               - Decoded bit sequence
